A Dolph-Chebyshev plot (or simply Dolph plot) is used in signal processing, particularly for analyzing and designing antenna arrays and digital filters. Here's how to read and interpret it:

Understanding the Axes:
The x-axis typically represents the spatial angle (for antenna arrays) or frequency (for filters). It might be in degrees, radians, or normalized units.
The y-axis represents the response magnitude, usually in decibels (dB) if dealing with logarithmic scales, or linear amplitude.
Main Lobe and Side Lobes:
The main lobe is the central peak, representing the primary direction of signal strength or passband in filters.
The side lobes are smaller peaks beside the main lobe. They indicate unwanted responses in directions other than the main lobe for antennas or out-of-band responses for filters.
Width of the Main Lobe:
This indicates the beamwidth in antenna arrays or the bandwidth in filters. A narrower main lobe implies higher resolution or selectivity.
Side Lobe Level:
This is crucial for understanding the suppression of unwanted signals. Lower side lobe levels indicate better performance in minimizing interference or noise.
Chebyshev Window:
The Dolph-Chebyshev plot is derived from the Chebyshev window function. This function is used to design filters and antenna arrays with optimal side lobe suppression.
Here's a step-by-step guide to interpreting the plot:

Steps to Interpret a Dolph-Chebyshev Plot:
Identify the Main Lobe:
Locate the highest peak. This is the main lobe. Measure its width at a specific level (e.g., 3 dB down from the peak) to understand the beamwidth or bandwidth.
Examine the Side Lobes:
Identify the peaks beside the main lobe. Note their height relative to the main lobe (often given in dB down from the peak of the main lobe).
Check the Uniformity:
In a Dolph-Chebyshev array, side lobes are typically designed to be of equal height. This uniformity is a hallmark of Chebyshev optimization.
Overall Shape:
The plot's symmetry and shape give insights into the array or filter's performance. Symmetrical plots are usually indicative of well-designed arrays or filters.
Example:
Suppose we have a Dolph-Chebyshev plot for a digital filter:

Main Lobe: Peaks at 0 dB (normalized amplitude), with a bandwidth of 0.1 (normalized frequency units).
Side Lobes: The first side lobe is at -30 dB, and the subsequent side lobes are at the same level, indicating equal side lobe level characteristic of Chebyshev filters.
Frequency Axis: Spans from -0.5 to 0.5 (normalized frequency).
Practical Applications:
Antenna Arrays: To design arrays with specific directional properties, minimizing interference from directions other than the main beam.
Digital Filters: To achieve a sharp cutoff with minimal passband ripple and controlled out-of-band attenuation.
Understanding the Dolph-Chebyshev plot involves recognizing these key features and how they relate to the performance characteristics of the system you're analyzing.
