Session: Generating Advanced Charts with Plotly in Python
Introduction

Welcome to this session on creating advanced charts with Plotly in Python. Plotly is a powerful library for creating interactive visualizations. Today, we'll cover three unique chart types: UpSet plots, Sankey diagrams, and Pyramid charts.

UpSet Plots

Description:
UpSet plots are used for visualizing intersecting sets. They are particularly useful for showing the relationships between different groups and the size of their intersections.

Applications:

Understanding overlapping categories in a dataset.
Analyzing the presence of multiple features across different datasets.
Plotly Code Example:

python
Copy code
import plotly.express as px

# Example data for UpSet plot
data = {
    'A': [1, 0, 1, 1, 0],
    'B': [0, 1, 1, 1, 0],
    'C': [1, 1, 0, 1, 1]
}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Create UpSet plot
fig = px.imshow(df, text_auto=True, aspect="auto", title='UpSet Plot')
fig.show()
Sankey Diagrams

Description:
Sankey diagrams are used to visualize flow and relationships between different entities. They show how quantities move from one set of entities to another, with the width of the arrows proportional to the flow quantity.

Applications:

Tracking energy or resource flow.
Visualizing user journey or workflow.
Showing budget allocation and expenditures.
Plotly Code Example:

python
Copy code
import plotly.graph_objects as go

# Example data for Sankey diagram
fig = go.Figure(data=[go.Sankey(
    node=dict(
        pad=15,
        thickness=20,
        line=dict(color="black", width=0.5),
        label=["A", "B", "C", "D", "E"],
        color=["blue", "green", "red", "purple", "orange"]
    ),
    link=dict(
        source=[0, 1, 0, 2, 3],
        target=[2, 3, 3, 4, 4],
        value=[8, 4, 2, 8, 4]
    ))])

fig.update_layout(title_text="Sankey Diagram", font_size=10)
fig.show()
Pyramid Charts

Description:
Pyramid charts, or population pyramids, are graphical representations of the distribution of a population by age and gender. They are shaped like a pyramid when the population is growing.

Applications:

Demographic studies.
Age distribution analysis.
