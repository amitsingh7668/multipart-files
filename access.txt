Presentation Story for Your Hackathon Project:
Introduction: Imagine starting a new job. You’re excited, ready to dive in, but there's one thing standing between you and being productive – access. In large companies like ours, new employees often face a maze of different systems, tools, and access requests. Trying to figure out what access to request, where to request it, and how to match up with other colleagues' access sets can be frustrating and time-consuming.

Problem Statement: In our company, we have dozens of different entitlement tools spread across multiple platforms. New joiners often don’t know where to raise access requests, which permissions they actually need, and it becomes a trial-and-error process. This confusion leads to wasted time, increased onboarding delays, and a drop in early productivity for employees.

Solution: That’s where [Your Project Name] comes in – a one-stop solution that simplifies access entitlement management. This tool is built with new employees in mind and aims to streamline the entire process.

Features:

Unified Access Request Hub: Instead of navigating through multiple tools, the user can raise all access requests from one interface. The system knows where the request should go and routes it automatically.
Compare with Peers: With our platform, users can compare their access requests with others in the same team or role. This feature gives them a clear idea of what access is typically needed, avoiding unnecessary back-and-forth with IT.
Request Sharing: Once access sets are fine-tuned, they can be shared with other team members or used as templates, reducing redundant requests and increasing efficiency.
Guided Recommendations: Based on the user’s role, department, or seniority, the system can suggest the appropriate access levels, cutting down guesswork.
Story Impact: For new joiners, this tool drastically cuts down the confusion and time required to get the right access. No more struggling with endless forms and waiting for multiple approvals. By being able to see what their peers or team members have access to, they can quickly align their permissions and be productive from day one.

Real-Life Scenario: Let me show you an example: Sarah joins the company as a Business Analyst. Previously, Sarah would have to figure out what systems she needs access to by asking around or sending emails to IT. Now, with our tool, she logs in, selects "Business Analyst," and the system instantly pulls up the standard access sets for her team. She can compare them with John, a colleague, and request access based on that. In minutes, she’s done – no frustration, no delays.

Conclusion: Our tool isn’t just about streamlining access; it’s about helping new employees feel confident, informed, and empowered from their very first day. With [Your Project Name], we’re taking the friction out of onboarding and putting the focus back where it belongs: on productive work.

Next Steps:
We see this tool being implemented across teams, departments, and regions, ensuring that anyone, anywhere in the company, has the access they need without confusion. From simplifying IT workloads to improving the employee experience, this is a game-changer for the way we manage access entitlement.

This story focuses on the real pain point of confusion and lost time while demonstrating how your project delivers a practical, user-friendly solution. Does this help align with your vision for the presentation?
